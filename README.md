# MetascienceTalk

This repo is for a presentation I made in LaTex Beamer for UBC MRI Physics group. The presentation is about metascience and how many of the incentives we have in science actually leads to bad science.
- The images folder contains the images used in the presentation
- The texfiles folder contains the LaTeX files
- The resources_papers folder contains some additional reading and papers cited in the presentation

The main file is the **ScienceIncentives.pdf** file, which is a softlink to the same file in the texfiles folder

Enjoy :)
